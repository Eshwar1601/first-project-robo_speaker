Robo Speaker
Robo Speaker is a Python-based voice assistant that uses text-to-speech (TTS) technology to interact with users. This project allows users to input text, which is then spoken out loud by the system using the pyttsx3 library, a popular offline TTS engine.

Features:
Text-to-Speech: Converts any text input into speech, allowing users to interact with the system through voice output.
Exit Command: Users can type "exit" to gracefully exit the program.
Continuous Interaction: The program continuously accepts user input and speaks the entered text until the "exit" command is given.
Libraries Used:
pyttsx3: Python library for text-to-speech conversion.
